This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

## NOTE: It's very important to make a copy of the ".env.example" file and place it in the same directory. Then, rename the copied file to ".env".

## Setting

First, install the dependencies:

## Commands

```sh
npm install --legacy-peer-deps
```


Then, install the generated icon:

```sh
npm install --save-dev @iconify/tools @iconify/utils @iconify/json @iconify/iconify --force
```


To generate the file generated-icon.css execute this command:

```sh
npm run build:icons
```


Finally, run the development server:

```sh
npm run dev             ## Execute this command to run the FRONTEND PROJECT
```
